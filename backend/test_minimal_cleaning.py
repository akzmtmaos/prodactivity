Okay, the user asked "what is 10 + 4?" which is a simple arithmetic question. My goal is to provide a clear and helpful response.

First, I'll acknowledge their question and explain that addition is the process of combining numbers together. Since they're asking for a straightforward answer, I can solve it quickly without needing complicated methods or multiple steps.

I should present the calculation clearly and concisely, making sure the user understands how to add 10 and 4 together. If this were part of a larger problem, I might consider offering more information, but since they've only provided this question, I'll stick to solving it as given.

It's also a good idea to offer further assistance in case they have more questions or need help with something else! Let me know if that works best.
</think>

Sure! 

**Question:** What is \\(10 + 4\\)?

To solve this, simply add the two numbers together:

\\[
10 + 4 = 14
\\]

So, the sum of \\(10 + 4\\) is **14**.

If you have any more questions or need help with something else, feel free to ask! üòä"""
